# checkers

This is a Python implementation of a checkerboard game using the Tkinter library. The game allows two players to take turns placing and moving their pieces on the checkerboard. The players can make moves by clicking on the board.

## How to Run

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:
   python final_checkers.py

The game window will open, and you can start playing by clicking on the checkerboard.
Game Rules
The game follows the standard rules of checkers, where each player tries to capture the opponent's pieces and advance their own pieces towards the opponent's side. The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or blocks them from making any legal moves.

Dependencies
The game requires the Tkinter library, which is a standard Python library for GUI development. It is usually included with most Python installations, so no additional installation should be required.
